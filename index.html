      <em>A grotesque video entitled ‘Daisy’s Destruction’ became a sort
 of urban legend online – and was said to feature unimaginable scenes of
 horror as adults tortured and raped a child. There was just one 
difference: Daisy’s Destruction is real, and its creator could now face 
the death penalty because of it. The video – widely discussed on forums 
and on Reddit as ‘the worst’ the internet had to offer – is not actually
 a snuff film, but features horrifying abuse and sexual assault of a 
young child. It was streamed on so-called ‘Hurtcore’ paedophile sites – 
where users paid up to $10,000 to stream videos of violent abuse and 
torture of children.</em></div>
